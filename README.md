# CryptLink 🔐
A secure web application designed for developers to communicate, share, and store files safely.

## 🚀 About the Project
- CryptLink was inspired by the 2022 Rockstar Games data leak, where hackers accessed internal Slack channels and extracted confidential files.  
- Our team designed CryptLink as part of our senior project to explore **data security, encryption, and usability** in modern web applications.
